## Author Guidelines

Our submission generally follows the WACV main conference.

1. **Submission Site**: Papers should be submitted via the OpenReview system. The link will be updated soon.
2. **Author Submission Guide**: [WACV 2026 Author Submission Guide](https://wacv.thecvf.com/Conferences/2026/AuthorReviewerGuides)  
<!-- 3. **Camera Ready Instructions**:  -->
1. **Workshop Website**: [5th LLVM-AD Workshop at WACV 2026](/WACV_2026)   

LLVM-AD accepts both **regular papers (6-8 pages)** and **demo papers (2-4 pages)**. Submissions are expected to follow the same [guidelines](https://wacv.thecvf.com/Conferences/2026/AuthorReviewerGuides) as those for WACV's main conference papers. All accepted demo papers will be included into the workshop proceedings. 

**Regular Papers**: Manuscripts of upto **8 pages**. 
<!-- The best paper elected by the committee will have the opportunity to receive outstanding paper award and **\$300** in recognition of their outstanding contributions. -->

**Demo Papers**: Manuscripts of upto **4 pages**. Demo papers should also include 1 additional page for references, maintaining the same formatting and guidelines. The main objective of these demo papers within the workshop is to foster the exchange of novel concepts and spotlight the practical utility of LLMs in the context of autonomous driving.

<!-- ## Submission Guidelines

All submissions will be handled electronically via CMT. The <a href=" ">Microsoft CMT service</a > was used for managing the peer-reviewing process for this conference. This service was provided for free by Microsoft and they bore all expenses, including costs for Azure cloud services as well as for software development and support. 

By submitting a paper, the authors agree to the policies stipulated on this website. WACV follows a two-round submission process. Please check the conference web pages for the most up-to-date deadlines.

- **Page Limit**: Papers are limited to eight pages, including figures and tables, in the WACV style. Additional pages containing only cited references are allowed.  
- **Templates**: Please refer to the WACV Author Kit ([Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/wacv-2025-author-kit-template/zfydvwqrjmsb), [ZIP Archive](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/su44zgdhrzik26p2xu37k/WACV-2025-Author-Kit-Template.zip?rlkey=5qcfimjhxnmx3wlyk7yhk8wg7&dl=0)).  
- **Rejection Policy**: Papers that are not properly anonymized, do not use the template, or exceed eight pages (excluding references) will be rejected without review. -->

<!-- ### Creating a Paper Submission 

TBD -->

<!-- - Click the **“+ Create new submission”** button in the upper-left to create a new submission. You will be prompted to enter the title, abstract, authors, and subject areas.  
- Ensure the following with your co-authors:
  1. Add them with their correct CMT3 email.  
  2. Verify that they have logged in to the submission website and filled out the conflict information on CMT3.  
  - If you add an author whose email is not in CMT3, and their name/organization is not automatically filled, confirm they do not already have an account under a different email before completing the required information.  
- **Paper Number**: Once your paper is registered (title/authors), you will be assigned a paper number. Insert this into the template before generating the PDF for submission. Papers submitted without a number may not be reviewed.   -->

### Other Submission Details  

- **Authorship Changes**:  
  - After the submission deadline, the list of authors will be considered final.  
  - New authors **cannot** be added, and authors **cannot** be removed.  
  - Changes to the authorship order will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances.  

- **Submission Requirements**:  
  - Maximum abstract size: 4000 characters.  
  - Paper format: PDF only (maximum size: 20MB). Ensure your paper meets the formatting and anonymity requirements described above.  

### Code Submission and Reproducibility  

To improve reproducibility in AI research, we highly encourage authors to voluntarily submit their code as part of the supplementary material.  

- Use the [Reproducibility Checklist](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf) as a guide for writing reproducible papers.  
- Reviewers are encouraged to check submitted code to ensure the trustworthiness and reproducibility of the paper’s results.  
- The code must be anonymized (e.g., remove author names and institutions, including in license/copyright statements).  
- Include clear instructions for setting up the environment and running the code.  
- The code should cover the main results and as many minor experiments as possible.  
- All submitted code and data will be reviewed confidentially and kept private.

<!-- For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like! -->

<!-- The LLVM-AD committee invites papers that will undergo the standard peer review process. We accept submissions through our **[CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/LLVMAD2024)**. If accepted, the workshop papers will be published in IEEE Xplore as WACV 2024 Workshop Proceedings (See previous WACV proceedings format [here](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/WACV2023_workshops/menu)) and will be indexed separately from the main conference proceedings. The papers submitted to the workshop should follow the same formatting requirements as the main conference. Program topics include:

- *Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Systems*

- *Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving Applications and Map Systems*

- *Foundation Vision Models for Autonomous Driving*

- *Generative AI for Autonomous Driving and Map Systems*

- *Semantics and Scene Understanding in Autonomous Driving*

- *Human-Vehicle Interaction*

- *Domain Adaptation and Transfer Learning in Autonomous Driving*

- *Safety in Autonomous Driving*

- *Interpretable AI in Autonomous Driving*

- *Trustworthy Autonomous Vehicles* -->

<!-- The first LLVM-AD workshop invites submissions that contribute to the progression of LLVM within the domain of autonomous driving. We are particularly interested in bridging the gap between the rich image and language data found within the context of autonomous driving. Our primary areas of interest are: a). Traffic Scene Understanding enhanced by LLVMs and 
b). Human-Vehicle Interactions driven by LLVMs. The detail will be released soon.


If accepted, the workshop papers will be published in IEEE Xplore as WACV 2024 Workshop Proceedings and will be indexed separately from the main conference proceedings. The papers submitted to the workshop should follow the same formatting requirements as the main conference. -->


<!-- Authors of the most exceptional demo papers will have chance to be invited to Tencent Map T Lab for an official summer internship. -->
