### Two Open-Source Datasets 

Two open-source datasets are provided for this workshop. The first dataset focuses on extracting traffic language from HD maps to aid in traffic scenario comprehension through LLMs. The second dataset aims to categorize textbased driver commands to improve human-vehicle language understanding. While using the datasets is recommended, it is **not mandatory** for participation. Both datasets will be released on **Sep. 15th**. 

#### Dataset 1
