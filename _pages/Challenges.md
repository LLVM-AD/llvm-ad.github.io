### Two Open-Source Datasets 

Two open-sourced datasets will be provided. The first centers on grasping traffic language from HD maps to understand traffic scenarios via LLMs. The second involves categorizing text-based driver commands into multiple categories for human-vehicle language comprehension. While the workshop recommends using provided datasets, it's **not mandatory**. Both datasets will be released on **Sep. 7th**. 

#### Dataset 1
