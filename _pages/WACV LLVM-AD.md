Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

The 1st [WACV](https://wacv2023.thecvf.com/) Workshop on **Large Language and Vision Models for Autonomous Driving (LLVM-AD)** seeks to bring together academia and industry professionals in a collaborative exploration of applying large language and vision models to autonomous driving. Through a half-day in-person event, the workshop will showcase regular and demo paper presentations and invited talks from famous researchers in academia and industry. Additionally, LLVM-AD will launch an open-source real-world traffic language understanding dataset upon workshop acceptance, catalyzing practical advancements. The workshop will host two challenges based on this dataset to assess the capabilities of language and computer vision models in addressing autonomous driving challenges.
