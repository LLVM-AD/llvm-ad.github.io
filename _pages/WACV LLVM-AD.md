<!-- ### About LLVM-AD -->
The 1st [WACV](https://wacv2023.thecvf.com/) Workshop on **Large Language and Vision Models for Autonomous Driving (LLVM-AD)** seeks to bring together academia and industry professionals in a collaborative exploration of applying large language and vision models to autonomous driving. Through a half-day in-person event, the workshop will showcase regular and demo paper presentations and invited talks from famous researchers in academia and industry. Additionally, LLVM-AD will launch two open-source real-world traffic language understanding datasets, catalyzing practical advancements. The workshop will host two challenges based on this dataset to assess the capabilities of language and computer vision models in addressing autonomous driving challenges.
